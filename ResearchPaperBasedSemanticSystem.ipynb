    "The solution consists of a three-layered pipeline for research paper-based semantic search. The Embedding Layer processes PDFs by extracting, cleaning, and chunking text to preserve context before generating vector embeddings using SentenceTransformers from HuggingFace. These embeddings are stored in ChromaDB for retrieval. Choosing the right chunking strategyâ€”fixed-length, semantic, or sliding windowâ€”is crucial for maintaining context. The Semantic Search Layer converts user queries into embeddings and performs vector similarity search in ChromaDB to retrieve the top results. A caching mechanism (e.g., Redis) enhances efficiency, while a re-ranking model (cross-encoder) improves result accuracy by refining search relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Generation Layer uses Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite to construct responses based on retrieved snippets. The prompt is carefully designed to ensure structured, concise answers with citations, proper formatting, and handling of out-of-scope queries. To improve response quality, few-shot examples can be incorporated. This structured approach ensures that the system delivers accurate, well-formatted, and research-backed responses, making it a powerful tool for analyzing complex research documents efficiently. ðŸš€\n"
